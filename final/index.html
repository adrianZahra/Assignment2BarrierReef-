<h1 id="rightboxtitle">The Barrier Reef Orchestra</h1>
<p>Fast becoming one of North Queensland&rsquo;s cultural jewels the Barrier Reef Orchestra this year launches its 15th year of performing orchestral music throughout North Queensland. A community orchestra consisting of the finest musicians drawn from as far afield as Cairns and Mackay, it focuses on unique orchestral juxtapositions. <br>
  <br>
  An outstanding performance of Beethoven&rsquo;s 9th Symphony presented to a sell-out audience was recently followed by Peter Sculthorpe&rsquo;s Mangroves, a collaboration with audio-visual artists, ABC radio and Umbrella Studios. The programs are testament to the orchestra&rsquo;s willingness to embrace mainstream classical repertoire as well as opportunities for collaboration. <br>
  <br>
  In 2015 the orchestra has been invited to perform in three festivals, and features in the Townsville Civic Theatre season. This is a first for the orchestra - underscoring its value to the community and highlighting its continued prominence in the cultural soundscape of North Queensland. </p>
