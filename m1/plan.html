<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>Through interaction and innovation the mission is to promote the 3 concerts a year and double the current number of people attending these concerts within a year of being online. The site aims to attract additional people as well as a younger audience.</p>

<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The success of the website will be evaluated by monitoring ticket sales to the concerts. When people purchase tickets to the orchestra, details on age and where they heard about the event will be taken. This will happen for tickets sold on the website and through other vendors. By cross checking this with available seating and the previous number of attendants the success of the website can be evaluated.</p>

<h2>Content</h2>
	<ul>
    	<li>Home</li>
        <p>The home page will contain a breif summary of the orchestra and also with a link to becoming a memebr to the orchestra</p>

    </ul>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience for the BRO website will vary in age and level of understanding of technology. The Barrier Reef Orchestra itself may include people of any age and occupation, while it is likely that the audience, and therefore the users of the site, may be in the 30+ age range. Therefore, when designing the site, there must be a very predictable navigation system with a clear logical layout.
There is a lot of content on the original site, which is largely text based. Because of the age and profile of the users, this larger content will still be effective.</p>
